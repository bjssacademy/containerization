# Using a Private Container Registry (ACR)
Up until now we have been pulling images from Docker Hub. Docker hub also allows you to publish your Images in their public registry, so you can share your container image goodness with others.\
That's great.. but there is a catch :) Docker limits the number of images that can be pulled for free users and you can only publish publicly.

Of course if you want to pay them money they can lift these limits and allow you to create your own Private repositories ([Pro and Enterprise Accounts](https://www.docker.com/pricing)) and many people do this.\
Although some people are still upset about Docker being [hacked](https://www.cbronline.com/news/docker-hacked) and their password being leaked! 

But there is another way, you can create your own. In our case we have used the [Azure Container Registry (ACR) service.](https://portal.azure.com/?quickstart=True#@bjssacademy.onmicrosoft.com/resource/subscriptions/a2bc1236-d4e1-4640-a89d-282eb8bbaa1d/resourceGroups/rg-academy-shared/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/acrbjssacademy/repository)

# Log into ACR

```bash
# Login to Azure if not already logged in
az login --tenant [ask tutor for tenant id]  --use-device-code

- follow the instructions shown in the console

# Login to ACR
az acr login --name acrbjssacademy

# Login to ACR with Docker (follow the login prompts)
# NB. If the command asks for username when running in WSL. Cancel the operation and run this command from a windows cmd prompt
docker login azure
```

# Push an Image to ACR
Lets push one of the images we built in an earlier exercise.

_Replace `<team>` and `<user-id>` with appropriate values in all the below examples!_

```bash
# assuming we built our image with the following tags
docker build . -t goapp/goapp:v1.0

# We tag the image with the ACR repo alias
docker tag goapp/goapp:v1.0 acrbjssacademy.azurecr.io/<team>/<user-id>-goapp:v1.0

# Now we push
docker push acrbjssacademy.azurecr.io/<team>/<user-id>-goapp:v1.0

# Confirm it worked by pulling it
docker pull acrbjssacademy.azurecr.io/<team>/<user-id>-goapp:v1.0
```

# Exercise - Pull someone elses Image

Ask one of your colleagues for their image name and Pull/Run it. Or alternatively look in ACR in the portal and find a container to run.
