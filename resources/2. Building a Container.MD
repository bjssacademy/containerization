# Building Your Own Container

## Prep
---

1. Create a directory in your workspace
2. Within the directory create file called `Dockerfile` (Case Sensitive)
3. Create another file called `app.sh`
4. Add the following content to `app.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

while [ true ]
do
        echo "Hello Everyone"
        echo "The time is: " $(date)
        sleep 10
done
```

## What is a Dockerfile?
---

A  Docker file is a file that describes how a container should be built.

## Building On Top Of An Existing Image
---
Whilst its possible to build a container from scratch, most people will build on top of an existing container.

To do this we start by adding a `FROM` line to the docker file. In our demo we are going to use the busybox image.

Alpine Linux is a commonly used base container. It is extremely small, so is ideal for a lightweight container.

So lets add that:

```docker
FROM alpine:3.17
```

Notice there is colon after the name of the image. This is a docker tag. Docker tags are arbitrary tags which can be used to mark specific builds of a container. It's commonly used to denote different versions.

You can see the available tags by looking on docker hub. See: <https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine?tab=tags>

If a tag isn't specified the default is to use a special tag called `:latest` its generally good practice to pin to a specific version of a container though so you don't introduce unexpected changed between rebuilds.

## Docker RUN
---
The `RUN` command is used to run arbitrary commands within a container at **Build** time and only at build time.

For this example we are going to use `RUN` to execute the `mkdir` command which creates a directory (app) into which we will copy our script:

```docker
FROM alpine:3.17

RUN mkdir app
```

## Adding Files to the Container
---
You need a way to add your application or other files to a container.

Docker offers two commands to achieve this. `COPY` and `ADD`. The main difference between the two commands is that `ADD` can add files from a URL and will also automatically unpack zipped files. Most of the time you  only need to use `COPY` but it's worth knowing.

```docker
FROM alpine:3.17

RUN mkdir /app
COPY app.sh /app
```

## Set A Default Command
---
If we want our container to automatically run our application/script we can use `CMD`. There should only be one `CMD` if multiple are specified then the last occurrence is used:

```docker
FROM alpine:3.17

# Create a directory for our files
RUN mkdir /app

# Copy the script to the new directory
COPY app.sh /app

WORKDIR /app

# Set our default command
CMD ["sh", "app.sh"]
```

## Building The Container
---
1. Open up a command prompt where your `Dockerfile` is
2. Run the following build command:

```bash
docker build .
```

## Run It
---
At this stage, you'll need to identify the image you just built by a hash value. This is output as the last line of the `docker build` command output from the previous step:
```
=> => writing image sha256:71de1148337f4d1845be01eb4caf15d78e4eb15a1ab96030809826698a5b7e30
```
In the example, the hash is the value without the leading `sha256:` marker i.e. `71de1148337f4d1845be01eb4caf15d78e4eb15a1ab96030809826698a5b7e30`.

_This is an example value - yours of course will be different!_

Once you've obtained the hash by copying it from your `docker build` output (not the value from the example!), run the image with that hash using the following command:

```bash
docker run <hash>
```

## Tagging
---
At the moment we just have an ugly looking hash for our container name. We can use tagging to give the container a name and also add a tag for the version.

The simplest way to to this is to provide a tag at build time.

```bash
docker build . -t demoapp/demoapp:v1.0
```

A word about `latest` if you don't provide a tag after the colon `:` then docker will add a default tag called `:latest` it is best to avoid using this tag when specifying images as it doesn't actually guarantee you will pull the `latest` image. Personally I feel it should have been named default!.

## Entrypoint vs CMD
---
In the container we just created we used `CMD` to tell the container what to run when it starts. There are actually two different commands to specify what a container should run when it starts it's worth understanding the differences between these and how they can be used together.

`CMD` - Specify a Command to run when the container starts. This can be overridden on the command line. Simply by passing a parameter.

```bash
# Container uses: CMD ["/bin/echo", "hello"]
# Override the CMD entry and run /bin/echo goodbye instead
docker run -it <image> /bin/echo goodbye

Output: goodbye
```

`Entrypoint` - Again this runs the specified command and arguments with the difference that passing an argument to the container will *NOT* override the default command. It will pass it as an argument to the existing command.

NB. You can still explicitly override the entrypoint with the right flags.

```bash
# Container uses: ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "hello"]
# Passing an argument appends it to the existing command
docker run -it <image> /bin/echo goodbye

Output: Hello world /bin/echo goodbye
```

### Why would you want to do that?

Some containers are used more like commands, where it is useful to be able to pass in parameters to a single command. eg. If you setup an entry point that run java, you could pass in a parameter for the jar file you want to run. Maybe you have a container that converts a string to base64, you could pass in the input string as a parameter.

Using both `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` - Sometimes you want to be able to override a parameter. In this case you can use both commands.

```bash
# Container uses: ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/echo", "hello"]
#                 CMD ["tim"]
# No arguments
docker run -it <image>

Output: hello tim

# now with a parameter
docker run -it <image> bill

Output: hello bill
```

Hopefully this made sense. If not check the links out for a good article explaining the difference in more detail.

## Some Best Practices
---
* **Keep it small** - Bigger containers are slower to download, can be slower to start and take up more space.
* **Run with least privilege** - Don't run your app as a root/admin user if you don't need to. If somebody exploits your application it will minimise the damage they can do.
* **Put the most generic commands first and copy your app files last** - It's good practice to install all your packages and dependencies first and then copy your application files last. This allows docker to make better use of it's layer cache and means builds are quicker. (See links)
* **Don't bake in environment specific config** - You don't want to have an image for every environment or variation of config. It's possible to mount external config in a container and this should be preferred vs baking in.
* **Never store secrets in an image** - Never store secrets such as API keys or passwords inside an image. Instead secrets should be passed into the container at run-time.
* **Use labels to add metadata to your images** - Labels are handy to add information about your build and can help you organise your images.
