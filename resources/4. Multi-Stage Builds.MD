# Multi-Stage Builds

Sometimes we want to build an application before we add it to our container, to do this we would need to install all of our dev tooling in our container. The final container image doesn't need this tooling after the application is built so we would have to remove it again.

Instead of installing the tooling, building and removing it again Docker offers us another way to achieve this, multi-stage builds.

In a multistage build we spin up a container with all our tooling eg. a `Go` compiler. We build our application then transfer only the files we need into our second image, disposing of the first.

Lets see what this looks like in action.

# Multi-Stage Go build

Create an empty directory to build your project in

Create a file called `app.go` and add the following content (you can type `code .` to open VSCode if you are not comfortable with editing in a terminal):

```go
package main

import "fmt"
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello BJSS Academy!")
}
```

Create a new Dockerfile and tell it to use the GoLang image to build. Then to copy the resulting binary that we compiled to the new image.

```docker
# Use the golang container and give it a friendly alias using AS
FROM golang:1.21.0 AS gobuild
ENV GO111MODULE=off
# Set our working directory
WORKDIR /go/src/bjss.com/academy/hello

# Copy the source file
COPY app.go .

# build the app
RUN go build -a -o app .

# Stage 2
FROM alpine:3.17

WORKDIR /app/

# Copy the app from the first container
COPY --from=gobuild /go/src/bjss.com/academy/hello/app .
CMD ["./app"]
```

## Build It

```bash
docker build . -t goapp/goapp:v1.0
```

## Run It

```bash
docker run goapp/goapp:v1.0
Hello BJSS Academy!
```

That's All.
