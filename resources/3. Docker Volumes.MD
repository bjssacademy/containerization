# Docker Volumes

Sometimes it's useful to have your docker container read and write to/from the file system of the host. To do this we can mount a volume on the host. In this exercise we will mount a local directory in our container and prove we can read and write to it.

# Mounting a Host Volume

```bash
# enter you home directory
cd ~

# Create a directory
mkdir dockertmp

# Create a file in there
echo "hello i am a file" > ./dockertmp/somefile
# Confirm the content
cat  ./dockertmp/somefile

# Run a container with a shell interactively
# nb. The local path is on the left and the destination path in the container is on the right and that the path to the host volume must be absolute
docker run  -v ~/dockertmp:/mnt/dockertmp -it ubuntu

# In the new shell confirm you can see the file you created on the host
ls /mnt/dockertmp
# You should see the content of this file
cat /mnt/dockertmp/somefile

# Now lets write a file
echo "a file from the container" >  /mnt/dockertmp/containerfile

# Confirm the content
cat /mnt/dockertmp/containerfile

#Exit the container
exit

# In your WSL session check if the file is there
ls ~/dockertmp
# and the content..
cat  ~/dockertmp/containerfile
```

There is a bit more complexity when it comes to volumes in docker. If you want to read up more on them then checkout the official docs.
